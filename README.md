## How to get started

It's very simple to use:
* make your DMTabBar class via code (it's an NSView subclass) or via IB
* create an NSArray of DMTabBarItems elements and assign it to DMTabBar tabBarItems property. Each item is a button and can have several attributes (you can simply set the NSImage's icon property)
* handle selection changes using - (void) handleTabBarItemSelection:(DMTabBarEventsHandler) selectionHandler; method.

It uses ARC and blocks so you it should be compatible with MacOS X 10.6 or later.
